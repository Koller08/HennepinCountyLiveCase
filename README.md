# HennepinCountyLiveCase

During my fall semester as a business analytics student for the Carlson School of Management in the Masters of Business Analytics program
I along with 3 other team members collaborated to create a Power BI dashboard displaying SNAP penetration rates and eligible 
store counts across geography, ethnicity, income, and time for Hennepin County. We collected and analyzed using R and Python census, income, and survey 
data to find an estimation of SNAP program eligibility and built a heat map to gain visibility of program usage across multiple factors. We presented a Power BI 
dashboard to Hennepin County highlighting top 10 areas of improvement as Finalist group.  This repository shows what we found.
